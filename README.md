# D2C

D2C(**D**ata-**dr**iven **C**ontrol Library) is a Data-driven Control Library based on reinforcement learning. It is a platform for reinforcement learning experiments and solving various control problems in the real-world Scenario. On the on hand, It makes the RL experiments Fast and convenient. On the other hand, It makes offline reinforcement learning technology be applied in the real world application more possibly and simplistically.

The supported RL algorithms include:

- [Twin Delayed DDPG with Behavior Cloning (TD3+BC)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06860.pdf)
- [Distance-Sensitive Offline Reinforcement Learning (DOGE)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11027.pdf)

## Features:

- Include a large collection of offline reinforcement learning algorithms: model-free offline RL, model-based offline RL, planning method and imitation learning. There are our self-developed algorithms and other advanced algorithms in each category.
- It is highly modular and extensible. It is easy for you to build custom algorithms and conduct experiments.
- Policy training process is automatic in real-world scenario applications. It simplifies the processes of problem definition, model training, policy evaluation and model deployment.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Documentation

The tutorials and API documentation are hosted on [d2c.readthedocs.io](https://zackxiangyu-d2c.readthedocs-hosted.com).

The example scripts are under [example/](https://gitlab.com/air_rl/algorithms-library/d2c/-/tree/dev/example/benchmark) folder and [test/](https://gitlab.com/air_rl/algorithms-library/d2c/-/tree/dev/test) folder.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage


## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
