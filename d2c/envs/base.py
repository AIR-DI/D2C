    The dynamics can be a model learned from the batch data. It can also be
    a ready-made external model. Please inherit this class to build these
    two class environments as needed.

    The main API methods that users of this class need to know are:

        step
        reset

    And set the following attributes:

        action_space: The Space object corresponding to valid actions
        observation_space: The Space object corresponding to valid observations
        reward_range: A tuple corresponding to the min and max possible rewards

    Note: a default reward range set to [-inf,+inf] already exists. Set it if you want a narrower range.

    The methods are accessed publicly as "step", "reset", etc...
